Lighthouse User Interface - Request for Proposal from StakeDAO by Stake Capital

Stake DAO is a revenue-sharing organization, enabling DAO token holders to continuously receive staking rewards and participate in key decision making processes via pro-rata governance rights. The Stake DAO Light Paper is available here and explores the economics and implementation in greater detail.

Stake DAO is looking to  to design and implement a fully-featured UI for Lighthouse, one of the leading Ethereum 2.0 client implementations. Lighthouse, which is developed by Sigma Prime, is entirely open-source and implemented in the Rust programming language.

The interface will be connected to the validator client and beacon node components of the Lighthouse client via their predefined HTTP endpoints. Like most Stake DAO dApps, the Lighthouse UI will be a static web-page built with React and Typescript served via a local HTTP server. Due to implementation via React, the web application will be easily convertible into an Electron app if required at a later date—enabling easy bootstrapping as a native application.

The main goal is to maximize the user experience, by focusing on the simplicity and security of a chain explorer for the Beacon chain that will arrive with Ethereum 2. The interface will not only remove the burden of using the command line but also to have a single interface which enables:

- Easily viewing and inspecting proposed blocks
- Understanding the inner workings of the Beacon Chain, including specific protocol-level parameters
- Compatibility with all mature Eth2 customer implementations
- Access to complete statistics and analytics around the overall health of the chain
- Monitoring specific performance metrics and statistics of Eth2 validators and beacon nodes that are exposed on the beacon node and validator client endpoints, including the display of each validator’s balance, recent past performance, as well as current and future duties
- Functionality for users to create new validators
- Functionality to submit deposits to the Eth1 deposit contract via the MetaMask browser extension in order to begin engaging with Eth2 for new users
- Redirect rewards to DeFi protocols in a few clicks
- Enable basic user interaction functions, including key-pair creation and management, display of and interactions with the Eth1 deposit contract, and starting, stopping and exiting a validator.

The diverse experience and skill-sets available within the Stake DAO team positions us ideally to successfully fulfill this Lighthouse proposal. As early contributors to Ethereum and with 10 years experience in the blockchain space, the Stake DAO team are seasoned veterans amongst the community. The team also has extensive experience with UX / UI development, as well as React and web3 development.
